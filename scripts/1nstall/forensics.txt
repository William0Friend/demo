Description: port scanner for discovering services on large networks
 doscan is a tool to discover TCP services on your network. It is
 designed for scanning a single ports on a large network.  doscan
 contacts many hosts in parallel, using standard TCP sockets provided
 by the operating system.  It is possible to send strings to remote
 hosts, and collect the banners they return.
 .
 There are better tools for scanning many ports on a small set of
 hosts, for example nmap.

 fingerprinting (remote host OS or device identification). Nmap also
 offers flexible target and port specification, decoy/stealth scanning,
 sunRPC scanning, and more. Most Unix and Windows platforms are
 supported in both GUI and commandline modes. Several popular handheld
 devices are also supported, including the Sharp Zaurus and the iPAQ.

Description: High-speed network authentication cracking tool
 Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool.
 It was built to help companies secure their networks by
 proactively testing all their hosts and networking devices
 for poor passwords. Security professionals also rely on
 Ncrack when auditing their clients. Ncrack was designed
 using a modular approach, a command-line syntax similar to
 Nmap and a dynamic engine that can adapt its behaviour
 based on network feedback. It allows for rapid, yet
 reliable large-scale auditing of multiple hosts.
 .
 Ncrack's features include a very flexible interface granting
 the user full control of network operations, allowing for
 very sophisticated bruteforcing attacks, timing templates
 for ease of use, runtime interaction similar to Nmap's and
 many more. Protocols supported include RDP, SSH, http(s),
 SMB, pop3(s), VNC, FTP, and telnet.
 .
 Be sure to read the Ncrack man page (https://nmap.org/ncrack/man.html)
 to fully understand Ncrack usage.

 host, and can be used to determine the structure of a foreign or
 local network. When running on the gateway of a network it is able
 to gather huge amounts of data and provide useful statistics. On a
 user-end computer it could be used as powerful IDS add-on. p0f
 supports full tcpdump-style filtering expressions, and has an
 extensible and detailed fingerprinting database.

  * a set of highly configurable danger thresholds (with sensible
    defaults provided);
  * verbose alert messages that include the source, destination,
    scanned port range, beginning and end times, TCP flags, and
    corresponding Nmap options;
  * reverse DNS information;
  * alerts via email;
  * automatic blocking of offending IP addresses via dynamic firewall
    configuration.
 .
 When combined with fwsnort and the iptables string match extension,
 PSAD is capable of detecting many attacks described in the Snort rule
 set that involve application layer data.

 virtual interface will be emitted by the real one.
 .
 It has been designed because one often has a small machine as their
 Internet gateway, and sometimes want to run some big applications
 that need raw access to this interface, for sniffing (Wireshark,
 etc.)  or for crafting packets that do not survive being reassembled,
 translated, routed, etc.

Description: Domain DNS scanner
 Fierce is a semi-lightweight scanner that helps locate non-contiguous
 IP space and hostnames against specified domains. It's really meant as
 a pre-cursor to nmap, unicornscan, nessus, nikto, etc, since all of
 those require that you already know what IP space you are looking for.
 This does not perform exploitation and does not scan the whole internet
 indiscriminately. It is meant specifically to locate likely targets both
 inside and outside a corporate network.
 .
 Because it uses DNS primarily you will often find mis-configured networks
 that leak internal address space. That's especially useful in targeted malware.
 Originally written by RSnake along with others at http://ha.ckers.org/.
 This is simply a conversion to Python 3 to simplify and modernize the codebase.

Description: genome assembly-to-assembly comparison
 atac computes a one-to-one pairwise alignment of large DNA sequences. It first
 finds the unique k-mers in each sequence, chains them to larger blocks, and
 fills in spaces between blocks. It was written primarily to transfer
 annotations between different assemblies of the human genome.
 .
 The output is a set of ungapped 'matches', and a set of gapped 'runs' formed
 from the matches. Each match or run associates one sequence with the other
 sequence. The association is 'unique', in that there is no other (sizeable)
 associations for either sequence. Thus, large repeats and duplications are not
 present in the output - they appear as unmapped regions.
 .
 Though the output is always pairwise, atac can cache intermediate results to
 speed a comparisons of multiple sequences.
 .
 This package is part of the Kmer suite.

Description: bioinformatics targeted assembly software
 Mapsembler2 is a targeted assembly software.
 It takes as input a set of NGS raw reads (fasta or fastq, gzipped or not)
 and a set of input sequences (starters).
 .
 It first determines if each starter is read-coherent, e.g. whether reads
 confirm the presence of each starter in the original sequence.
 Then for each read-coherent starter, Mapsembler2 outputs its sequence
 neighborhood as a linear sequence or as a graph, depending on the user choice.
 .
 Mapsembler2 may be used for (not limited to):
  - Validate an assembled sequence (input as starter), e.g. from a de
    Bruijn graph assembly where read-coherence was not enforced.
  - Checks if a gene (input as starter) has an homolog in a set of reads
  - Checks if a known enzyme is present in a metagenomic NGS read set.
  - Enrich unmappable reads by extending them, possibly making them mappable
  - Checks what happens at the extremities of a contig
  - Remove contaminants or symbiont reads from a read set

Description: marks duplicates, extracts discordant/split reads
 Current "next-generation" sequencing technologies cannot tell what
 exact sequence they will be reading. They take what is available. And
 if some sequences are read very often, then this needs some extra
 biomedical thinking. The genome could for instance be duplicated.
 .
 samblaster is a fast and flexible program for marking duplicates in
 read-id grouped paired-end SAM files. It can also optionally output
 discordant read pairs and/or split read mappings to separate SAM files,
 and/or unmapped/clipped reads to a separate FASTQ file. When marking
 duplicates, samblaster will require approximately 20MB of memory per
 1M read pairs.

Description: Remote OS identification
 Xprobe2 allows you to determine what operating system is running on a
 remote host. It sends several packets to a host and analyses the
 returned answers.
 .
 Xprobe2's functionality is comparable to the OS fingerprinting feature
 in nmap (written by a different Fyodor):
  - Outputs its level of confidence about the OS on the remote host.
  - Remains usable even if intermediate systems (routers, firewalls) make
    slight modifications to the packets.
  - Can list the type of intermediate device (e.g. "Linux IP masquerading").
  - Modular architecture allows new fingerprinting tests and new OS
    signatures to be added.
