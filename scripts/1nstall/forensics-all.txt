Description: Advanced Forensics Format Library (utilities)
 The Advanced Forensic Format (AFF) is on-disk format for storing
 computer forensic information. Critical features of AFF include:
 .
  - AFF allows you to store both computer forensic data and associated
    metadata in one or more files.
  - AFF allows files to be digital signed, to provide for
    chain-of-custody and long-term file integrity.
  - AFF allows for forensic disk images to stored encrypted and
    decrypted on-the-fly for processing. This allows disk images
    containing privacy sensitive material to be stored on the Internet.
 .
 This package provides the AFF Toolkit, that is a set of programs for
 working with computer forensic information. Using these tools you can:
  * Interconvert disk images between a variety of formats, including:
      - raw or "dd";
      - splitraw (in which a single image is split between multiple files);
      - AFF format (in which the entire disk image is stored in a single
        file);
      - AFD format (in which a disk image is stored in multiple AFF files
        stored in a single directory);
      - AFM format (in which an AFF file is used to annotate a raw file).
  * Compare disk images and report the data or metadata that is different.
  * Copy disk images from one location to another, with full verification
    of data, metadata, and the automatic generation of a chain-of-custody
    segment.
  * Find errors in an AFF file and fix them.
  * Print information about a file.
  * Print detailed statistics about a file
  * Generate a XML representation of a disk image's metadata (for example,
    acquisition time or the serial number of the acquisition device).
  * Produce a XML "diskprint" which allows a disk image to be rapidly
    fingerprinted without having the computer the SHA1 of the entire
    disk.
 .
 The AFF Toolkit provides these executables: affcat, affcompare, affconvert,
 affcopy, affcrypto, affdiskprint, affinfo, affix, affrecover, affsegment,
 affsign, affstats, affuse, affverify and affxml.

 aircrack-ng is an 802.11a/b/g WEP/WPA cracking program that can recover a
 40-bit, 104-bit, 256-bit or 512-bit WEP key once enough encrypted packets
 have been gathered. Also it can attack WPA1/2 networks with some advanced
 methods or simply by brute force.
 .
 It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations,
 thus making the attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools.
 It can also fully use a multiprocessor system to its full power in order
 to speed up the cracking process.
 .
 aircrack-ng is a fork of aircrack, as that project has been stopped by
 the upstream maintainer.

 library, so it is compatible with magic signatures created for the Unix
 file utility.
 .
 Binwalk also includes a custom magic signature file which contains
 improved signatures for files that are commonly found in firmware images
 such as compressed/archived files, firmware headers, Linux kernels,
 bootloaders, filesystems, etc.

Description: Mass SNMP scanner
 Braa is a mass snmp scanner. The intended usage of such a tool is of course
 making SNMP queries - but unlike snmpget or snmpwalk from net-snmp, it is able
 to query dozens or hundreds of hosts simultaneously, and in a single process.
 Thus, it consumes very few system resources and does the scanning VERY fast.
 .
 Braa implements its OWN snmp stack, so it does NOT need any SNMP libraries
 like net-snmp. The implementation is very dirty, supports only several data
 types, and in any case cannot be stated 'standard-conforming'! It was designed
 to be fast, and it is fast. For this reason (well, and also because of author
 laziness ;), there is no ASN.1 parser in braa - the user HAVE to know the
 numerical values of OID's
 (for instance .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 instead of system.sysName.0).

Description: try to find the passphrase for files encrypted with OpenSSL
 bruteforce-salted-openssl try to find the passphrase or password of a file
 that was encrypted with the openssl command. It can be used in two ways:
 .
    - Try all possible passwords given a charset.
    - Try all passwords in a file (dictionary).
 .
 bruteforce-salted-openssl have the following features:
 .
    - You can specify the number of threads to use when cracking a file.
    - The program should be able to use all the digests and symmetric ciphers
      available with the OpenSSL libraries installed on your system.
    - Sending a USR1 signal to a running bruteforce-salted-openssl process
      makes it print progress and continue.
    - There are an exhaustive mode and a dictionary mode.
 .
 In the exhaustive mode the program tries to decrypt the file by trying all
 possible passwords. It is especially useful if you know something about the
 password (i.e. you forgot a part of your password but still remember most of
 it). Finding the password of the file without knowing anything about it would
 take way too much time (unless the password is really short and/or weak).
 There are some command line options to specify:
 .
    - The minimum password length to try.
    - The maximum password length to try.
    - The beginning of the password.
    - The end of the password.
    - The character set to use (among the characters of the current locale).
 .
 In dictionary mode the program tries to decrypt the file by trying all the
 passwords contained in a file. The file must have one password per line.
 .
 This package is useful for security, pentests and forensics investigations.

 .
 Another tool provided by CeWL project is FAB (Files Already
 Bagged). FAB extracts the content of the author/creator fields,
 from metadata of the some files, to create lists of possible
 usernames. These usernames can be used in association with the
 password list generated by CeWL. FAB uses the same metadata
 extraction techniques that CeWL. Currently, FAB process Office
 pre 2007, Office 2007 and PDF formats.
 .
 CeWL is useful in security tests and forensics investigations.

 of "any-snarf" program, as it will fetch telnet sessions, FTP files, HTTP
 transfers (HTML, GIF, JPEG etc) and SMTP emails from the captured data inside
 network traffic logs. A html index file is created to that links to all the
 session details, including realtime replay programs for telnet, rlogin, IRC,
 X11 and VNC sessions. Chaosreader reports such as image reports and HTTP
 GET/POST content reports.
 .
 It also creates replay programs for telnet sessions, so that you can play
 them back in realtime (or even different speeds).
 .
 Chaosreader can also run in standalone mode, where it invokes tcpdump or
 snoop (a similar to tcpdump program for Solaris) to create the log files
 and then processes them.
 .
 This package is useful for forensics investigations and for network traffic
 analysis.

 classic CGI scanner, but remember that it is a content scanner not a
 vulnerability scanner.
 .
 DIRB's main purpose is to help in professional web application auditing.
 Specially in security related testing. It covers some holes not covered by
 classic web vulnerability scanners. DIRB looks for specific web objects that
 other generic CGI scanners can't look for. It doesn't search vulnerabilities
 nor does it look for web contents that can be vulnerable.

Description: read/write encrypted BitLocker volumes
 Dislocker has been designed to read BitLocker encrypted partitions under
 a Linux system. The driver used to read volumes encrypted in Windows system
 versions of the Vista to 10 and BitLocker-To-Go encrypted partitions,that's
 USB/FAT32 partitions.
 .
 The software works with driver composed of a library, with multiple binaries
 using this library. Decrypting the partition, you have to give it a mount
 point where, once keys are decrypted, a file named dislocker-file appears.
 This file is a virtual NTFS partition, so you can mount it as any NTFS
 partition and then read from or write to it. Writing to the NTFS virtual
 file will change the underlying BitLocker partition content.
 .
 This tool is useful in cryptography managing and forensics investigations.

Description: collects data about allocated files in mounted filesystems
 mac-robber is a digital investigation tool (digital forensics) that collects
 metadata from allocated files in a mounted filesystem. This is useful during
 incident response when analyzing a live system or when analyzing a dead
 system in a lab. The data can be used by the mactime tool in The Sleuth Kit
 (TSK or SleuthKit only) to make a timeline of file activity. The mac-robber
 tool is based on the grave-robber tool from TCT (The Coroners Toolkit).
 .
 mac-robber requires that the filesystem be mounted by the operating system,
 unlike the tools in The Sleuth Kit that process the filesystem themselves.
 Therefore, mac-robber will not collect data from deleted files or files that
 have been hidden by rootkits. mac-robber will also modify the Access times
 on directories that are mounted with write permissions.
 .
 mac-robber is useful when dealing with a filesystem that is not supported
 by The Sleuth Kit or other filesystem analysis tools. You can run mac-robber
 on an obscure, suspect UNIX filesystem that has been mounted read-only on a
 trusted system.

 Magic Rescue scans a block device for file types it knows how to recover
 and calls an external program to extract them. It looks at "magic bytes"
 (file patterns) in file contents, so it can be used both as an undelete
 utility and for recovering a corrupted drive or partition. As long as
 the file data is there, it will find it.
 .
 Magic Rescue uses files called 'recipes'. These files have strings and
 commands to identify and extract data from devices or forensics images.
 So, you can write your own recipes. Currently, there are the following
 recipes: avi, canon-cr2, elf, flac, gpl, gzip, jpeg-exif, jpeg-jfif,
 mbox, mbox-mozilla-inbox, mbox-mozilla-sent, mp3-id3v1, mp3-id3v2,

Description: fast, parallel, modular, login brute-forcer for network services
 Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login
 brute-forcer. The goal is to support as many services which allow remote
 authentication as possible. The author considers following items as some of
 the key features of this application:
      * Thread-based parallel testing. Brute-force testing can be
        performed against multiple hosts, users or passwords
        concurrently.
      * Flexible user input. Target information (host/user/password) can
        be specified in a variety of ways. For example, each item can be
        either a single entry or a file containing multiple entries.
        Additionally, a combination file format allows the user to
        refine their target listing.
      * Modular design. Each service module exists as an
        independent .mod file. This means that no modifications are
        necessary to the core application in order to extend the
        supported list of services for brute-forcing.

Description: data recovery tool for problematic or damaged media
 Safecopy tries to get as much data from SOURCE as possible, even resorting
 to device specific low level operations if applicable. This is achieved by
 identifying problematic or damaged areas, skipping over them and continuing
 reading afterwards. The corresponding area in the destination file is either
 skipped (on initial creation that means padded with zeros) or deliberately
 filled with a recognizable pattern to later find affected files on a corrupted
 device. The work is similar to ddrescue, generating an image of the original
 media. This media can be floppy disks, harddisk partitions, CDs, DVDs, tape
 devices, where other tools like dd would fail due to I/O errors.
 .
 Safecopy uses an incremental algorithm to identify the exact beginning and
 end of bad areas, allowing the user to trade minimum accesses to bad areas
 for thorough data resurrection.
 .
 Multiple passes over the same file are possible, to first retrieve as much
 data from a device as possible with minimum harm, and then trying to retrieve
 some of the remaining data with increasingly aggressive read attempts.
 .
 Safecopy includes a low level I/O layer to read CDROM disks in raw mode,
 and issue device resets and other helpful low level operations on a number
 of other device classes.
 .
 Safecopy is useful in forensics investigations and disaster recovery.

Description: tools for forensics analysis on volume and filesystem data
 The Sleuth Kit, also known as TSK, is a collection of UNIX-based command
 line file and volume system forensic analysis tools. The filesystem tools
 allow you to examine filesystems of a suspect computer in a non-intrusive
 fashion. Because the tools do not rely on the operating system to process the
 filesystems, deleted and hidden content is shown.
 .
 The volume system (media management) tools allow you to examine the layout of
 disks and other media. You can also recover deleted files, get information
 stored in slack spaces, examine filesystems journal, see partitions layout on
 disks or images etc. But is very important clarify that the TSK acts over the
 current filesystem only.
 .
 The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk labels), Mac
 partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT disks. With these
 tools, you can identify where partitions are located and extract them so that
 they can be analyzed with filesystem analysis tools.
 .
 Currently, TSK supports several filesystems, as NTFS, FAT, exFAT, HFS+, Ext3,
 Ext4, UFS and YAFFS2.
 .
 This package contains the set of command line tools in The Sleuth Kit.

 Snowdrop provides reliable, difficult to remove steganographic watermarking of
 text documents (internal memos, draft research papers, advisories and other
 writing) and C sources (limited distribution software, licensed software,
 or freely available code) so that:
  (1) leaks can be identified if the data goes public.
  (2) original source can be determined and demonstrated if part of the
      document is claimed by somebody else, copied without permission, etc.
 Snowdrop uses redundant steganography using four different logical
 channels, and should be proof to many modifications, including reformatting,
 spell checking and so on.
 .
 This package is useful in forensic investigations and security actions. It
 provides three commands: sd-eng, sd-engf and sd-c. sd-eng and sd-engf provide
 watermarking for draft-quality and fine-quality English language text
 documents, respectively, whereas sd-c provides experimental C source code
 watermarking.
 .
 Warning: Snowdrop is currently in beta, and may produce bad or corrupted
 results, especially when run on C source code.

 viewers, the message is effectively hidden from casual observers. And if the
 built-in encryption is used, the message cannot be read even if it is detected.
 .
 About the name: locating trailing whitespace in text is like finding a polar
 bear in a snowstorm. And it uses the ICE encryption algorithm, so the name is
 thematically consistent.

Description: Forensic tool to find hidden processes and ports
 Unhide is a forensic tool to find processes and TCP/UDP ports hidden by
 rootkits, Linux kernel modules or by other techniques. It includes two
 utilities: unhide and unhide-tcp.
 .
 unhide detects hidden processes using the following six techniques:
   * Compare /proc vs /bin/ps output
   * Compare info gathered from /bin/ps with info gathered by walking thru the
     procfs.
   * Compare info gathered from /bin/ps with info gathered from syscalls
     (syscall scanning).
   * Full PIDs space occupation (PIDs bruteforcing)
   * Reverse search, verify that all thread seen by ps are also seen by the
     kernel (/bin/ps output vs /proc, procfs walking and syscall)
   * Quick compare /proc, procfs walking and syscall vs /bin/ps output
 .
 unhide-tcp identifies TCP/UDP ports that are listening but are not listed in
 /bin/netstat through brute forcing of all TCP/UDP ports available.
 .
 This package can be used by rkhunter in its daily scans.
 .
 This package is useful for network security checks, in addition to forensics
 investigations.

Description: Forensics tool to find processes hidden by rootkits
 Unhide.rb is a forensics tool to find processes hidden by rootkits.
 .
 It looks for active processes in many different ways. Processes found by
 some means but not others are considered to be "hidden", and are reported
 to the user.
 .
 Unhide.rb is a tentative of rewrite in Ruby of the original Unhide, which
 is written in C. While being much faster, it does not implement all the
 diagnostics of the original version. It is also less secure as it cannot
 be statically compiled.
 .
 This package can be used by rkhunter in its daily scans.

Description: web application vulnerability scanner
 Wapiti allows you to audit the security of your web applications.
 It performs "black-box" scans, i.e. it does not study the source code of the
 application but will scan the web pages of the deployed web applications,
 looking for scripts and forms where it can inject data.
 Once it gets this list, Wapiti acts like a fuzzer, injecting payloads to see
 if a script is vulnerable.
 .
 Wapiti can detect the following vulnerabilities:
  - Database Injection (PHP/ASP/JSP SQL Injections and XPath Injections)
  - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) reflected and permanent
  - File disclosure detection (local and remote include, require, fopen,
    readfile...)
  - Command Execution detection (eval(), system(), passtru()...)
  - XXE (Xml eXternal Entity) injection
  - CRLF Injection
  - Search for potentially dangerous files on the server (thank to the Nikto db)
  - Bypass of weak htaccess configurations
  - Search for copies (backup) of scripts on the server
  - Shellshock
  - DirBuster like
  - Server Side Request Forgery (through use of an external Wapiti website)

Description: secure file deletion
 Recovery of supposedly erased data from magnetic media is easier than
 what many people would like to believe. A technique called Magnetic
 Force Microscopy (MFM) allows any moderately funded opponent to recover
 the last two or three layers of data written to disk. Wipe repeatedly
 writes special patterns to the files to be destroyed, using the fsync()
 call and/or the O_SYNC bit to force disk access.
 .
 Wipe can permanently delete data in hard disks and flash drives (caution!
 several writes can damage solid medias).
 .
 This program is useful in anti-forensics and security activities.

Description: tool to crossmount between multiple input and output harddisk images
 xmount allows you to convert on-the-fly between multiple input
 and output harddisk image types. xmount creates a virtual file
 system using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) that contains a
 virtual representation of the input harddisk image. The virtual
 representation can be in raw DD, VirtualBox's virtual disk file
 (VDI) format, Microsoft's Virtual Hard Disk Image format (VHD)
 or in VMware's VMDK format. Input harddisk images can be raw DD
 or EWF (Expert Witness Compression Format) or AFF (Advanced
 Forensic Format) files. In addition, xmount also supports
 virtual write access to the output files that is redirected to a
 cache file. This makes it for example possible to boot acquired
 harddisk images using QEMU, KVM, VirtualBox, VMware or alike.
